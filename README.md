# pysparkonpolars
A pyspark compatible API on top of polars

Polars enables data scientists and engineers to conveniently develop their projects locally on their laptop. When it comes to running the code on larger datasets, they might require the power of spark and distributed computing. By developing a pyspark compatible API on top of Polars we aim to enable development of python code that can run on both on Polars and Spark, making projects easily portable across the two systems.
